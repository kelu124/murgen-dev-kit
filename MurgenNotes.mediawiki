#A pulse is sent to the transducer (1st image)
#The transducer listens to the echos, trains or packets of a couple of periods at 3.5MHz . These trains are 4+ periods wide, and are more attenuated the deeper they come from (image 2)
#The signal goes to a VGA to rectify attenuation (TGC) - output, the same frequencies, amplitudes corrected (image 3)
#This goes through a low-pass -- to remove all frequencies above the 1.5 - 5 MHz band of interest.
# This goes through the enveloppe detection  (image 4)
# This goes to the ADC
# This is output to the buffer (if needed)

* TLDR
** CapTech Workshop. Was great!
** Acted upon a split between a FPGA long-term approach, and a non-FPGA one. I remembered those good old times when this was a possibility.
** Damn it. What if I could dig into this? Not µC, rather an extension for an existing computer.. or mini computer.
** Saw some ideas on the Arduino's side. Separate ADC.

* BBB 
**How to use it?
***http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/05/22/bbb--working-with-the-pru-icssprussv2
***For low-speed comms, conventional I2C or similar protocols can be used, and there is no need to use a PRU. For high-speed comms the PRU may be extremely useful because it can service the hardware with no interruptions due to Linux context switching, and no overhead is experienced by the main ARM processor. Here are some examples that should be feasible; basically quite a few possibilities, such as '''interfacing to a fast ADC (e.g. analog capture)''',
**https://theembeddedkitchen.net/beaglelogic-building-a-logic-analyzer-with-the-prus-part-1/449 BBB is a 100MHz logic analyzer on a BeagleBoneBlack
**Demo over the http://beaglelogic.github.io/webapp/
**http://r.git.net/beagleboard/2013-10/msg00204.html
***Can the PRU be used to interface the Beaglebone to external ADC? I need to  capture 500 micro-seconds of data at a 5 MHz rate. 
*** -> ''It depends on the interface to the ADC.  There is a parallel capture interface that will easily run that fast, and you may be able to use the bit-shift interface to do serial or something like SPI if the PRU's  capability lines up with what your ADC wants to see.'' 
** http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
*** ''In its current state, it grabs analog data from an ADC, and dumps it into memory on the BBB, ready to be displayed or further processed. It could be used for gathering analog information from sensors, CCDs or other data acquisition use-cases. To be reasonably useful, the desire was for it to support 20Mbytes/sec of data or more. It does achieve this, but it is for further study to find higher speed methods.''
*** ''This is not such a bad idea, because in future the ADC could be swapped out to a (say) 10-bit ADC with no code change on the PRU.''
*** '''Once the data has been captured (2000 samples in this example), the command byte is acknowledged, so that the Linux hosted application can know that the PRU has completed. The PRU now sits and waits for a new instruction from the Linux hosted application.''' -> works for us - fixed depth = fixed # of samples
** Buffer to be used : detailed at http://www.element14.com/community/community/designcenter/single-board-computers/next-gen_beaglebone//blog/2013/08/04/bbb--high-speed-data-acquisition-and-web-based-ui
*** ''These were extremely important for two reasons. One reason is that the pins to the BBB that I wished to use need to be isolated during power-up, because they are used for selecting the boot method. If there was any unusual level on the pins upon power-up then the BBB will not boot from the eMMC. So, a tri-state buffer is needed. The other reason is that there is a fair bit of capacitance and it is highly likely that the ADC may not be able to directly drive the pins at high speed. I actually came across this problem while trying to connect a camera to the BBB. I struggled for days without realising that the camera could not support the load. So, the buffers are likely to be essential for most designs using the pins that were selected. I used a 74LVC244A device as a buffer. Note that the clock also needs a buffer, unless significant jitter is acceptable. No tri-state is required here, so I used a MC74VHC1GT50.

** Some limits - not exploiting all ? http://exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter13/#The_ADS7883_Single-Channel_12-bit_ADC_1MSps_max
** SPI speed with BBB : http://fr.mathworks.com/help/supportpkg/beagleboneio/ug/use-the-beaglebone-black-spi-interface-to-connect-to-a-device.html (up to 32MHz) - which is
*16 bits :  ''is it possible to set all 16 pins on pru0 as inputs? I saw you mentioned something about disabling the microSD functionality on the BB to get access to all 16 pins, but I wasn't exactly sure how.'' -- heartofasquid 
** I thought the PRUs had a 16bit parallel capture mode or are all the pins not available on the BBB?  (need to consult the docs) section 4.5.2.2.3.2 of the tech ref spruh73c.pdf  One thought I had was to use both PRUs to capture alternate bytes/words but that was just a thought, again are all the pins available?
** I'd made a mistake, it looks like all of PRU0's GPI pins may be available, if we are happy to lose the microSD (no big loss - there are other ways to get data in/out of the BBB). So, we can theoretically get high-res captures up to about 15bits, if we need 1 pin for the clock.

* IDEA : interfacing murgen with a FPGA ? Solution here : store.hackaday.com/products/xula2-lx9
* IDEA: doing a probe emulator?  Signal generation upon a pulse transmitted : a physical emulator for the probe head =)

* Passphrase.io seems interesting =)

* What can we do with wifi / ESP8266 // http://makezine.com/2015/04/01/esp8266-5-microcontroller-wi-fi-now-arduino-compatible/ ?
* http://darksearch.io/ is fun ?
* No stuff - https://sivers.org/gifts in favor of it =)
* Some news from Amit

=== Feb 25th ===
* Boards reached: issue with the 5V and GND - shortage

=== Feb 26th ===
* Further tests. Shortage still exists. 
** Short is not on the PCB. Appears after solder.
* Found that the RECOM component was designed to be upside down -- need to resolder it. Luckily it was a via component. 
** This would not be the source of the short anyhow. 
** EF recommends that we burn 10A on the 5V plane to see which component would burn.. hmm i'm quite shy to do this :p
* Documenting the issue on github.
* Sending back boards to EF.

=== Feb 29th ===
* Found the source of the short, ADL5511, 5V and GND inverted...
** TODO : amend the altium files to correct the ADL5511 and the RECOM tracks
* TODO : sampling freq to be documented

=== Mar 1st ===
* Sending back the boards

=== Mar 3rd ===
* Receiving new, corrected boards
* SO qusetions to be tapped into?
